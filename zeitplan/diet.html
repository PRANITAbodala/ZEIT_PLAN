        <p class="sectiontag text-big">Fruits</p>
        <p class="sectionsubtag text-medium">Fruits are nutritious, they make a tasty snack or dessert, and they can satisfy a sweet tooth.
            <br>
            Local fruits that are in season are fresher and provide more nutrients than imported fruits.
            <br>
            Fruits are high in sugar, but this sugar is natural. Unlike candies and many sweet desserts, fruits also provide fiber and other nutrients. This means they’re less likely to cause a sugar spike and they’ll boost the body’s supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.
            <br>
            If you have diabetes, your doctor or dietitian can advise you on which fruits to choose, how much to eat, and when.</p>

        <p class="sectiontag text-big">grains</p>
        <p class="sectionsubtag text-medium">Refined white flour is featured in many breads and baked goods, but it has limited nutritional value. This is because much of the goodness is in the hull of the grain, or outer shell, which manufacturers remove during processing.

            Whole grain products include the entire grain, including the hull. They provide additional vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Many people also find that whole grains add flavor and texture to a dish.
            <br>
            Try switching from white breads, pastas, and rice to whole grain options.</p>
